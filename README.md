# Lucky Dog

Lucky dog is a website created for a fictional small business providing dog walking services in the Cork City area. 
The website is for anyone that owns or cares for a dog and may not have the time, or may not be physically able to walk their dogs every day.

The primary goal of the website from the site owner's perspective is to lead potential customers to make contact with the business in order to book a dog walker.

The primary goal of the website from a user's perspective is to easily find a professional, reliable dog walker in Cork City and make contact with them to arrange a walk.

 
## UX
 
This website is for dog owners in the Cork City area who are unable to walk their dogs every day.
As a user, they can find out about the dog walkers background and experience to ensure they are confident in the dog walkers ability and experience in handling dogs, the pricing structure for the service and how to contact the business.

This project will ensure the user can clearly understand what service the business provides, and how to make contact to book a walk by providing an intuitive, responsive website.
